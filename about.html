                <h2 class="content-heading">Background</h2>
                <p>I'm 21 years old and recently finished high school about three years ago. My path hasn't been traditional, but it's been driven by curiosity and a desire to build skills that matter.</p>
                <p>I started by teaching myself front-end development, but after some time, I realized I wanted something more challenging and multidisciplinary. That's when I discovered mechanical engineering — a field that combines problem-solving, design, physics, and hands-on creation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="content-heading">Current Path</h2>
                <p>I'm starting as a full-time freshman majoring in Mechanical Engineering. While studying, I'm continuing to work in sales at Camping World, where I've developed strong communication skills and learned how to understand what people actually need versus what they say they want.</p>
                <p>My technical background in coding gives me an edge — I understand how to automate processes, work with data, and think systematically about problems. I'm excited to combine these skills with mechanical design and engineering principles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="content-heading">What Drives Me</h2>
                <p>I'm motivated by building things that matter and learning skills that compound over time. Whether it's coding a web application, closing a sale, or designing a mechanical system, I approach everything with the goal of getting better every day.</p>
                <p>My goal is to become someone who can bridge multiple disciplines — engineering, technology, and business. I believe the most valuable people are those who can see the whole picture and execute at every level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="content-heading">Beyond Work</h2>
                <p>Outside of studying and work, I spend time at the gym working toward fitness goals, enjoy late-night walks to clear my head, and read books on philosophy, self-improvement, and technical subjects. I'm also picking up writing as a way to organize my thoughts and communicate more clearly.</p>
                <p>I speak English, Russian, and Romanian fluently, which has given me perspective on different cultures and ways of thinking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="content-heading">Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>Over the next few years, I plan to build a strong foundation in mechanical engineering while continuing to develop my coding skills. I'm particularly interested in projects that combine hardware and software — IoT devices, automation systems, and web interfaces for physical products.</p>
                <p>I update this portfolio regularly as I work on new projects and develop new skills. If you're reading this and think we could work on something interesting together, reach out.</p>
